Heaven may cry
--------------
Disclaimer: the game is currently in super mega early developement.
--------------

Heaven may cry is a retro shooter greatly inpired by the original Doom game and Ultrakill.
While the Gunplay and movement mechanics are considered to be of utmost importance,
this project puts great emphasis on its Health system and aims to create an original one.

--------------

Health system: 
Unlike most other movement based retro shooter, in Heaven may cry, the player cannot restore the health they lost fighting the enemies.
One might then think that it is stupid to not be able to heal in a fps single player game.
And they're right. That's why Health management is done by switchinbg dimensions.
The core mechanic of the game is that the player can at any time they decide to, at a certain cost, switch dimensions (Heaven or Hell). In each dimension, the player has a disctinct Health-bar.
Letting them switch dimensions to manage their health when faced with enemies.

--------------

As for now, this is only a prototype, but everything is planned out and will be added to the game as time goes on.
Thanks for your time. Have a good day :D
